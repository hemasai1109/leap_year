# leap_year
This is a Simple Project using python to check whether an year is leap year or not.   

The Logic is Simple..  
When The user inputs an year , it will check  for divisibility of that year by 4,100 and 400   
If Year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100,,then it is a leap year.otherwise its not a leap year.  
If it is divisible by 4 and 100 , then it must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year i.e.,if the year is divisible by 4 , 100 and not divisible by 400 then it is not a leap year
